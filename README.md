# Fundamentals-of-Computer-Systems-and-Engineering-ECE-550D.001.Fa24

Course Description
Fundamentals of computer systems and engineering for Master's students whose undergraduate background did not cover this material. Topics covered include: Digital logic, assembly programming, computer architecture, memory hierarchies and technologies, IO, and hardware implementation in HDL. Undergraduates may not take this course, and should take ECE 250D, ECE 353, and/or ECE 356 instead. 3 units. 

Learning Outcomes

1.Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:

2.design combinational and sequential circuits at the transistor (CMOS) and gate/logic levels;

3.implement, simulate, and test logic circuits;

4.use Verilog hardware description language;

5.write programs using Assembly language;

6.describe and analyze how computer memory operates;

7.describe the basic operations of IO devices, interrupts, and exceptions; and design, implement, and test a processor.
